# What is Vocal Bootcamp?
 
This app provides a custom warm-up routine based on the user’s voice type and goal. It will generate audio examples of various warmups. It will also generate a routine based on the user’s voice ‘type’. (ex. Soprano, alto, tenor, bass). 

The problem it solves is some vocalists don’t know what warmups to do to improve. The solution is to give them the resources of instructional warm-ups in the categories chosen to guide them in improvement.

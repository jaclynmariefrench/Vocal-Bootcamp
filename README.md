# What is Vocal Bootcamp?
 
This app provides a custom warm-up routine based on the user’s voice type and goal. It will generate audio examples of various warmups. It will also generate a routine based on the user’s voice ‘type’. (ex. Soprano, alto, tenor, bass). 

The problem it solves is some vocalists don’t know what warmups to do to improve. The solution is to give them the resources of instructional warm-ups in the categories chosen to guide them in improvement. 

### How I worked on this project

This application initiated during my time with Nashville Software School, where we needed to develop a front-end web application using React. 

### How to navigate this project



### Why I built the project this way

At the time of me creating this app I was a fulltime music teacher and I found it hard to assign students with warm-ups to do on a weekly basis. I thought having an app where students can know what warmups to do and having the ability to take notes would be very helpful. 

### If I had more time I would change this

If I had more time I would refine the styling, maybe go into more of a draggable widget interface. I would also want to implement a backend admin experience for a teacher to upload more audio warmups for their students and also be able to manage their students accounts.
